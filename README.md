# CA2-Clustering-Algorithm
A basic clustering algorithm. Initial uploaded version has 5 datapoints to sort, which are hardcoded in a list, and separates them into two clusters based on Euclidean distance from two centroids (coordinates of centroids also initially hardcoded) as required by assessment criteria. Aspirations for future development are 1/ user input of datapoints 2/ variable number of clusters 3/ user defined limitation on number of iterations performed.
